Just a random streak of bad luck.&nbsp; It looks steady to me.<br><br>Competition doesn't have an effect until the next automatic retarget adjustment, and we haven't reached the next one yet.<br><br>The adjustments are every 2016 blocks.&nbsp; To calculate our progress towards the next one, divide the block total by 2016.&nbsp; The fractional part is how far we are to the next one.&nbsp; <br><br>My back-of-the-envelope projection: 42032 blocks/2016 = 20.85 = 85% of the way.&nbsp; About 1.5 days to go until the next one.&nbsp; That'll only be about 10 days since the last one, the target is 14 days, so 14/10 = 1.4 = around 40% difficulty increase.
