Not locktime.<br><br>There's a possible design for far in the future:<br><br>You intentionally write a double-spend. &nbsp;You write it with the same inputs and outputs, but this time with a fee. &nbsp;When your double-spend gets into a block, the first spend becomes invalid. &nbsp;The payee does not really notice, because at the moment the new transaction becomes valid, the old one becomes invalid, and the new transaction simply takes its place.<br><br>It's easier said than implemented. &nbsp;There would be a fair amount of work to make a client that correctly writes the double-spend, manages the two versions in the wallet until one is chosen, handles all the corner cases. &nbsp;Every assumption in the existing code is that you're not trying to write double-spends.<br><br>There would need to be some changes on the Bitcoin Miner side also, to make the possibility to accept a double-spend into the transaction pool, but only strictly if the inputs and outputs match and the transaction fee is higher. &nbsp;Currently, double-spends are never accepted into the transaction pool, so every node bears witness to which transaction it saw first by working to put it into a block.
