There are command line options:<br><br>bitcoin -addnode=1.2.3.4&nbsp; &nbsp; to tell bitcoin about a node to connect to<br>bitcoin -connect=1.2.3.4&nbsp; &nbsp; connect only to the specified node(s)<br><br>You can use more than one of these, for instance<br>bitcoin -connect=(first to try) -connect=(next to try) ...<br><br>You can specify non-routable IPs with -connect like 192.168.x.x, so if you had a server farm and you wanted one server to connect to the world and the rest to connect to the one server, you could do that.<br><br>In particular, -addnode is needed if you're always going to connect through TOR, since the IRC server blocks all the TOR exit nodes.&nbsp; To connect through TOR, you could use:<br><br>bitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -addnode=212.159.72.216
