Bitcoin addresses you generate are kept forever. &nbsp;A bitcoin address must be kept to show ownership of anything sent to it. &nbsp;If you were able to delete a bitcoin address and someone sent to it, the money would be lost. &nbsp;They're only about 500 bytes.<br><br>sirius-m:<br>Thousands of own addresses should not be any problem at all.&nbsp; If you've generated 50000 BTC, then you already have 1000 own addresses, one for each 50 generated.&nbsp; Those are hidden, they're not shown in the UI.<br><br>It would be a good idea to add a little code that keeps giving the same address to the same IP. &nbsp;Here's what I did in C++ to keep giving the same key (aka bitcoin address) until they use it:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// Keep giving the same key to the same ip until they use it<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if (!mapReuseKey.count(pfrom-&gt;addr.ip))<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mapReuseKey[pfrom-&gt;addr.ip] = GenerateNewKey();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;...sends the key mapReuseKey[pfrom-&gt;addr.ip]<br><br>...later...<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// Received something with this key<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;mapReuseKey.erase(pfrom-&gt;addr.ip);<br><br>If it's not convenient to know when you've received, just clear the cached keys every 20 minutes.<br><br>I want to add a parameter to getnewaddress for number of days to expire if nothing is received with the address.
