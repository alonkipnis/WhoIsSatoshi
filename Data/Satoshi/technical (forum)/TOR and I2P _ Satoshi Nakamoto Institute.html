I've been thinking about that for a while. &nbsp;I want to add the backend support for .onion addresses and connecting to them, then go from there.<br><br>There aren't many .onion addresses in use for anything because the user has to go through a number of steps to create one. &nbsp;Configure TOR to generate a .onion address, restart TOR, configure it with the generated address. &nbsp;Perhaps this is intentional to keep TOR so it can't be integrated into file sharing programs in any sufficiently automated way.
