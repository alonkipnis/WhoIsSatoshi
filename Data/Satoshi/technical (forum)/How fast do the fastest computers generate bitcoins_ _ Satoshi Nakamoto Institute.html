I've noticed that hashing performance doesn't vary as much between CPUs as you'd expect.&nbsp; Compared to an old CPU, a newer CPU doesn't show as much of a speedup at hashing as it does on general benchmarks.<br><br>I guess recent CPU optimizations must have concentrated on things like I/O and branch prediction.&nbsp; Most programs are a bunch of memory access, comparisons and branching, they rarely get down to cranking away at maths for very long.<br><br>The latest SVN version has a khash/s display.&nbsp; Around 400 khash/s per processor is typical.
