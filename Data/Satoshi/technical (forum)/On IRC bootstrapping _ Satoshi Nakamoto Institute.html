Thanks soultcer for talking with the Freenode staffer.&nbsp; Good to know it's OK at the current size, and now they know who we are.&nbsp; They're supportive of projects like TOR so I hope they would probably be friendly to us.&nbsp; We don't want to overstay our welcome.&nbsp; If we get too big, then by the same token, we're big enough that we don't need IRC anymore and we'll get off.<br><br>We only needed IRC because nobody had a static IP.&nbsp; In the early days there were some steady supporters, but they all had pool-allocated IPs that change every few days.&nbsp; IRC was only intended as a temporary solution.&nbsp; Bitcoin's built-in addr system is the main solution.<br><br>Bitcoin can get the list of IPs from any bitcoin node.&nbsp; In that sense, every node serves as a directory server.<br><br>When there are enough static IP nodes to have a good chance that at least one will still be running by the time the current version goes out of use, we can preprogram a seed list.<br><br>How do you think we should compile the seed list?&nbsp; Would it be OK to create it from the currently connected IPs that have been static for a while?<br><br>BTW, if we want to supplement by deploying separate directory server software, may I suggest IRC?&nbsp; IRC is a good directory server (I've heard it has other uses too), and there are mature IRC server implementations available that anyone can run. <img alt="Smiley" border="0" src="./On IRC bootstrapping _ Satoshi Nakamoto Institute_files/smiley.gif">&nbsp; Bitcoin's IRC client implementation is already thoroughly tested.
