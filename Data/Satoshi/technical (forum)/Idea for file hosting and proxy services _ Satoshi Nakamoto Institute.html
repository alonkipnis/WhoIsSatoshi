When you want to upload an image to embed in a forum post, there are services like imageshack, but because they're free, they limit the number of views. &nbsp;It's a minuscule amount of bandwidth cost, but they can't just give it away for free, there has to be something in it for them. &nbsp;It would be nice to be able to pay for the bandwidth and avoid the limits, but conventional payments are too inconvenient for such a minor thing.<br><br>It's worse if you want to upload a file for others to download. &nbsp;There are services like rapidshare, but they require the downloaders to go through extra steps and delays to make them look at advertising or encourage upgrading to a paid subscription, and they limit it to 10 or so downloads.<br><br>It would be nice if we made some free PHP code for an image and file hosting service that charges Bitcoins. &nbsp;Anyone with some extra bandwidth quota could throw it on their webserver and run it. &nbsp;Users could finally pay the minor fee to cover bandwidth cost and avoid the limits and hassles. &nbsp;Ideally, it should be MIT license or public domain.<br><br>Services like this would be great for anonymous users, who have trouble paying for things.
