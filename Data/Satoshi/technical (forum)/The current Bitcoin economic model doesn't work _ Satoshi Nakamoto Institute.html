Excellent analysis, xc.<br><br>A rational market price for something that is expected to increase in value will already reflect the present value of the expected future increases. &nbsp;In your head, you do a probability estimate balancing the odds that it keeps increasing.<br><br>In the absence of a market to establish the price, NewLibertyStandard's estimate based on production cost is a good guess and a helpful service (thanks). &nbsp;The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost. &nbsp;If the price is below cost, then production slows down. &nbsp;If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and selling more. &nbsp;At the same time, the increased production would increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price.<br><br>In later years, when new coin generation is a small percentage of the existing supply, market price will dictate the cost of production more than the other way around.<br><br>At the moment, generation effort is rapidly increasing, suggesting people are estimating the present value to be higher than the current cost of production.
