We had our first automatic adjustment of the proof-of-work difficulty on 30 Dec 2009. &nbsp;<br><br>The minimum difficulty is 32 zero bits, so even if only one person was running a node, the difficulty doesn't get any easier than that. &nbsp;For most of last year, we were hovering below the minimum. &nbsp;On 30 Dec we broke above it and the algorithm adjusted to more difficulty. &nbsp;It's been getting more difficult at each adjustment since then.<br><br>The adjustment on 04 Feb took it up from 1.34 times last year's difficulty to 1.82 times more difficult than last year. &nbsp;That means you generate only 55% as many coins for the same amount of work.<br><br>The difficulty adjusts proportionally to the total effort across the network. &nbsp;If the number of nodes doubles, the difficulty will also double, returning the total generated to the target rate.<br><br>For those technically inclined, the proof-of-work difficulty can be seen by searching on "target:" in debug.log. &nbsp;It's a 256-bit unsigned hex number, which the SHA-256 value has to be less than to successfully generate a block. &nbsp;It gets adjusted every 2016 blocks, typically two weeks. &nbsp;That's when it prints "GetNextWorkRequired RETARGET" in debug.log.
