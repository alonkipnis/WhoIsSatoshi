Release notes for Bitcoin v0.1 Alpha<br><br>Bitcoin is a new electronic cash system that uses a peer-to-peer <br>network to prevent double-spending.  It's completely decentralized<br>with no server or central authority.<br> <br>You can find screenshots and the download link at:<br>http://www.bitcoin.org<br> <br>Windows only for now.  Open source C++ code is included.<br><br>- Unpack the files into a directory<br>- Run BITCOIN.EXE<br>- It automatically connects to other nodes<br><br>If you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections,<br>you'll really be helping the network a lot.  Port 8333 on your<br>firewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.<br><br>The software is still alpha and experimental.  There's no guarantee<br>the system's state won't have to be restarted at some point if it<br>becomes necessary, although I've done everything I can to build in<br>extensibility and versioning.<br><br>You can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on<br>Options-&gt;Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks.  I made<br>the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so<br>for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to<br>generate coins in just a few hours.  It'll get a lot harder when<br>competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.<br>Generated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be<br>spent.<br><br>There are two ways to send money.  If the recipient is online, you<br>can enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public<br>key and send the transaction with comments.  If the recipient is<br>not online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which<br>is a hash of their public key that they give you.  They'll receive<br>the transaction the next time they connect and get the block it's<br>in.  This method has the disadvantage that no comment information<br>is sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used<br>multiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can't<br>be online at the same time or the recipient can't receive incoming<br>connections.<br><br>Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins.  It'll be distributed<br>to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half<br>every 4 years.<br><br>first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins<br>next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins<br>next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins<br>next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins<br>etc...<br><br>When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if<br>needed.  It's based on open market competition, and there will<br>probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.<br>
