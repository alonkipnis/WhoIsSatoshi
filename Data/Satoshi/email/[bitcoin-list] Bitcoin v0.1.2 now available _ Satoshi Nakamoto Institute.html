Bitcoin v0.1.2 is now available for download.<br><br>See http://www.bitcoin.org for the download link.<br><br>All the problems I've been finding are in the code that<br>automatically finds and connects to other nodes, since I wasn't<br>able to test it in the wild until now.  There are many more ways<br>for connections to get screwed up on the real Internet.<br><br>Bugs fixed:<br>- Fixed various problems that were making it hard for new nodes to<br>see other nodes to connect to.<br>- If you're behind a firewall, it could only receive one<br>connection, and the second connection would constantly disconnect<br>and reconnect.<br><br>These problems are kind of screwing up the network and will get<br>worse as more users arrive, so please make sure to upgrade.<br>
