Version 0.2.6 on SVN can now run as a daemon and be controlled by command line or JSON-RPC.<br><br>On Linux it needs libgtk2.0-0 installed, but does not need a GUI running. &nbsp;Hopefully gtk can be installed without having a windowing system installed.<br><br>The command to start as a daemon is:<br>bitcoin -daemon [switches...]<br><br>Or, to run the UI normally and also be able to control it from command line or JSON-RPC, use the "-server" switch.<br>bitcoin -server [switches...]<br><br>With either switch, it runs an HTTP JSON-RPC server that accepts local socket connections on 127.0.0.1:8332. &nbsp;The port is bound to loopback and can only be accessed from the local machine, but from any account, not just the user it's running under.<br><br>To control it from the command line, the interface is a command name without any switches, followed by parameters if any.<br>bitcoin &lt;command&gt; [params...]<br><br>For example:<br>bitcoin getinfo<br>bitcoin getdifficulty<br>bitcoin setgenerate true<br>bitcoin stop<br><br>It's a simple JSON-RPC client and prints the JSON result. &nbsp;Look at rpc.cpp for the list of commands.<br><br>Web apps or anything automated will normally use JSON-RPC directly, not command line. &nbsp;There are JSON-RPC libraries for all the major languages. &nbsp;In script languages like PHP and Python the syntax is as natural as calling a local function.
