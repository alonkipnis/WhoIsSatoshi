Thank you for the offer to help translate. &nbsp;That is probably the best way you could help.<br><br>I will need to prepare the code for translation first. &nbsp;wxWidgets has locale support, and most strings are in generated code that is already wrapped, so it shouldn't be too hard. &nbsp;We also must finish upgrading to wxWidgets-2.9.0 to get UTF-8 support. &nbsp;I've done test builds with 2.9.0 and there is one bug left to fix. <br><br>What operating system are you using? &nbsp;Windows, Linux 32-bit or 64 bit?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Split from <a href="https://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=44">another thread</a>.<br>sirius-m</span>

It's much easier to have a single binary and multiple .mo files.&nbsp; It's too much maintenance work to have lots of build variations.&nbsp; Once the software support is implemented, anyone could contribute translations.<br><br>wxWidgets uses the gettext standard.&nbsp; You use the gettext tools or something like poedit to create a .po file by scanning the sourcefiles for strings and editing the translations into the .po file, then compile it into a .mo file.&nbsp; The program loads the .mo file at runtime and reskins all the strings.&nbsp; Additional languages can be added to an existing program by adding .mo files without recompiling the program.<br><br>On Windows, the .mo files would go in a lang subdirectory in the directory where the EXE is located.<br><br>Right now I'm working on JSON-RPC and command line support, but when I'm finished with that I hope to do this next.

I updated the SVN with changes to support translation.&nbsp; Translatable strings are all enclosed in _(""), and we're using UTF-8 on all platforms.<br><br>When the program runs, it looks in the directory of the EXE for the file: locale\&lt;langcode&gt;\LC_MESSAGESitcoin.mo<br><br>&lt;langcode&gt; is the two letter code of the language your OS is set to, like "de" or "nl".<br><br>On Linux, it also looks for:<br>/usr/share/locale/&lt;langcode&gt;/LC_MESSAGES/bitcoin.mo<br>/usr/local/share/locale/&lt;langcode&gt;/LC_MESSAGES/bitcoin.mo<br>(are there other standard places it should look on linux?)<br><br>Here's a quick walkthrough using poedit to make a .po and .mo file:<br><br>- Download the bitcoin sourcecode from SVN<br>- In the trunk directory, mkdir locale\&lt;lang&gt;\LC_MESSAGES<br>- In poedit, File-&gt;New catalog-&gt;Paths tab<br>- Click the "New item" dotted rectangle button<br>- Put "../../.." and MAKE SURE TO PRESS ENTER to add the path<br>- Click OK<br>- Save the file as "bitcoin.po" in the LC_MESSAGES directory you made<br>- It should then scan the sourcecode and find about 170 strings<br>- If it didn't find anything, check Catalog-&gt;Settings-&gt;Path tab, make sure the "../../.." was added<br><br>When you're done translating, commit both bitcoin.po (the editable catalog file) and bitcoin.mo (compiled data used by the program).<br>
