Are you just trying to run the program or do you really need to compile it?&nbsp; There's a 32-bit linux binary that can be run on 64-bit ubuntu if you "sudo apt-get ia32-libs".<br><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.2.0-linux.tar.gz/download">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.2.0-linux.tar.gz/download</a><br><br>I recently updated the SVN for building on 64-bit Karmic with wxWidgets 2.9.0.&nbsp; This was after the 0.2.0 release.&nbsp; The 0.2.0 release did not build on 64-bit yet.<br><br>Unfortunately there currently isn't a -dev deb package of either of the versions of wxWidgets that we can use.&nbsp; On Karmic they only have the UTF-16 version.&nbsp; We need either the ANSI (libwxgtk2.8-ansi-dev) version or the UTF-8 (wxWidgets 2.9.0) version.&nbsp; We're moving towards 2.9.0.<br><br>I know you said you didn't want VM, but as a last resort, last I checked the Windows version runs fine in Wine.
