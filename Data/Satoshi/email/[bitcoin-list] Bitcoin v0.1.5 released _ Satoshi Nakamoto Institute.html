Version 0.1.5 is now available. It includes the fix for the problem
Nicholas had, checking for disk full and changes to try to improve
things that were confusing.

Special thanks to Nicholas and Dustin for all their help and feedback!

Changes:
- disk full warning
- fixed a bug that could occur if dns lookup failed
- prevent entering your own address in the address book,
which confusingly changed the label for your own address
- moved change address button to menu under options
- tweaks to make it get connected faster
- close sockets on exit
- created minimum fee for transactions less than 1 cent
- hid the transaction-type selection box that only had one choice
- cleaned up ParseMoney a little
- slightly cleaner reformatting of message text
- changed the font in transaction details dialog
- added some explanation text to transaction details for generated coins
- reworded the description for transactions received with bitcoin address


The next thing for v0.1.6 is to take advantage of multiple
processors to generate blocks. Currently it only starts one
thread. If you have a multi-core processor like a Core Duo or
Quad this will double or quadruple your production.

Later I want to add interfaces to make it really easy to integrate
into websites from any server side language.


The current version will work fine. They'll each connect over the
Internet, while incoming connections only come to the host that
port 8333 is routed to. 

As an optimisation, I'll make a switch "-connect=1.2.3.4" to make
it only connect to a specific address. You could make your extra
nodes connect to your primary, and only the primary connects over
the Internet. It doesn't really matter for now, since the network
would have to get huge before the bandwidth is anything more than
trivial.

Indeed, Bitcoin is a distributed secure timestamp server for
transactions. A few lines of code could create a transaction with
an extra hash in it of anything that needs to be timestamped. 
I should add a command to timestamp a file that way.

Exactly.
