I finished everything on my list to do for version 0.3. &nbsp;The code on SVN is about ready to release.<br><br>Testing at this point is much appreciated.

Here's RC1 for windows for testing:<br>(removed, see RC2 below)<br><br>Please only download this if you're going to test and report back whether everything seems fine or not. &nbsp;Make sure to look through the files in 

What operating system?<br><br>Normally when it does that it's because the directory where the data directory should go doesn't exist. &nbsp;See if the "%appdata%" directory exists.<br><br>Do you get that error with 0.2 also? &nbsp;It's hard to see how you could get that with 0.3 and not with 0.2 since there's nothing different in that regard.<br>

davidonpda, were you also running laszlo's build previously?<br><br>Check if the "%appdata%" directory exists, and "%appdata%itcoin"<br><br>Try:<br>&nbsp;rename "%appdata%itcoin" bitcoin2 <br><br>does it work then?

You figured it out faster than I could post a reply. &nbsp;<img alt="Smiley" border="0" src="./0.3 almost ready -- please test the Mac version! _ Satoshi Nakamoto Institute_files/smiley.gif"><br><br>It looks like laszlo's build of Berkeley DB has database/log.* files that are not compatible with ours. &nbsp;The .dat files are fine, their format shouldn't ever change. &nbsp;All data is stored in the .dat files. &nbsp;All your own data is stored in wallet.dat. &nbsp;If you had waited for it to redownload the block chain, your missing transactions and generateds would have appeared as the block chain reached the point where those transactions were recorded.<br><br>When you copied the directory except log.0000000002, that's the best solution.&nbsp; You should be good now.<br><br>The database/log.* files only contain temporary database data. &nbsp;If you exited bitcoin normally the last time, not exited by forced terminating it or crashing, then the database/log.* files can normally be deleted safely. &nbsp;They're only used so that if the database is in the middle of a transaction when the computer crashes or the program is killed or crashes, then it could recover without losing data.<br><br>Please keep running v0.3 if at all possible, don't go back to v0.2.10.<br><br>Anyone else who hits this problem, move the database\log.000000000* files somewhere else.&nbsp; (if it works fine after that, you can delete them later)<br><br>I'm reluctant to make the installer delete or move those files.&nbsp; If the previous run was stopped by crashing or killed, that would be the wrong thing to do.<br>

Laszlo figured out that enabling some more optimisation increased performance about 20%, so 0.3 hashes 20% faster than 0.2.0, but I assume he used that in his own build.<br><br>30khash increase to what total rate?&nbsp; (to figure the % increase)

Here's RC1 for linux for testing:<br>(link removed, see below)<br><br>It contains both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries.<br><br>Recent changes:<br><br>build-unix.txt:<br>- Added instructions for building wxBase, which is needed to compile bitcoind.<br>- The package libboost-dev doesn't install anything anymore, you need to get libboost-all-dev.<br>- Updated version numbers.<br><br>makefile.unix:<br>- The libboost libraries have removed the "-mt" from their filenames in 1.40. &nbsp;If you're compiling with Boost 1.38 or lower, like on Ubuntu Karmic, you would need to change it back to boost_system-mt and boost_filesystem-mt.

I don't know. &nbsp;Maybe someone with more Linux experience knows how to install the library it needs.<br><br>I built it on Ubuntu 10.04. &nbsp;I hope that wasn't a mistake. &nbsp;Maybe it should have been built on an older version for more backward compatibility. &nbsp;Is this a problem on Linux, that if you build on the latest version, then it has trouble working on older versions?&nbsp; Is there any way I can downgrade to an older version of GCC on 10.04?<br><br>The 64-bit version shouldn't be any faster than the 32-bit version, but it would be great if someone could do a side-by-side comparison of the two linux versions and check. &nbsp;SHA-256 is a 32-bit algorithm and nothing in BitcoinMiner uses 64-bit at all.<br><br>We don't need to bother with a 64-bit version for Windows. &nbsp;32-bit programs work on all versions of Windows. &nbsp;It's not like Linux where the 64-bit OS wants 64-bit programs.<br><br>I'm also curious if it's a little faster on linux than windows.<br><br>Do you think I should make the directories:<br>/bin32/<br>/bin64/<br>instead of<br>/bin/32/<br>/bin/64/

Thanks virtualcoin, that's a perfect comparison.<br><br>The 8% speedup from 32-bit Windows (2310k) to 32-bit Linux (2500k) is probably from the newer version of GCC on Linux (4.4.3 vs 3.4.5).<br><br>The 15% speedup from 32-bit to 64-bit Linux is more of a mystery.&nbsp; The code is completely 32-bit.<br><br>Hmm, I think the 8 extra registers added by x86-64 must be what's helping.&nbsp; That would make a significant difference to SHA if it could hold most of the 16 state variables in registers.

Lets try using Laszlo's irc.lfnet.org instead of freenode. &nbsp;Here's RC2, that's the only change in it:<br><br>(see below for download links)<br>

The first panel of the status bar is shared with the help description of menu items as you hover over them.&nbsp; Since all our menu item descriptions are blank, it replaces it with blank when you're hovering in a menu.

Changed the version number to 1.3 and removed "Beta".<br><br>(links removed, see below)<br><br>Uses irc.lfnet.org.

MinGW still only has good old stable 3.4.5. &nbsp;There's not much reason for them to update it. <br><br>When I looked at the 3.4.5 compiled SHA disassembly, I couldn't see any room for improvement at all. &nbsp;I can't imagine how 8% more could be squeezed out of it. &nbsp;Is it possible Windows could have 8% more overhead?&nbsp; Not making system calls or anything, just plain busy computational code, could task switching and other housekeeping operations take away that much?
