It sets different priorities for each thread. &nbsp;The generate threads run at PRIO_MIN. &nbsp;The other threads rarely take any CPU and run at normal.<br><br>#define THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PRIO_MIN<br>#define THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL &nbsp; &nbsp;2<br>#define THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0<br><br>The priorities converted from Windows priorities were probably from a table like this:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "The following table shows the mapping between nice values and Win32 priorities.

Laszlo corrected this, but unfortunately it was too late to make it into 0.3.0. &nbsp;There will probably be a 0.3.1 soon though.<br><br>The problem is I used PRIO_MIN, I should have used PRIO_MAX for the lowest priority. &nbsp;The OS isn't supposed to let you increase priority, so the PRIO_MIN ought to leave it at priority 0.
