A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would<br>allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another<br>without the burdens of going through a financial institution.<br>Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main<br>benefits are lost if a trusted party is still required to prevent<br>double-spending.  We propose a solution to the double-spending<br>problem using a peer-to-peer network.  The network timestamps<br>transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based<br>proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without<br>redoing the proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as<br>proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came<br>from the largest pool of CPU power.  As long as honest nodes control<br>the most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest<br>chain and outpace any attackers.  The network itself requires<br>minimal structure.  Messages are broadcasted on a best effort basis,<br>and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the<br>longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they<br>were gone.<br><br>Full paper at:<br>http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf<br><br>
