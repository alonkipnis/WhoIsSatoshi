ribuck's description is spot on.<br><br>Pool operators can modify their getwork to take one additional parameter, the address to send your share to.<br><br>The easy way for the pool operator would be to wait until the next block is found and divy it up proportionally as:<br>user's near-hits/total near-hits from everyone<br><br>That would be easier and safer to start up. &nbsp;It also has the advantage that multiple hits from the same user can be combined into one transaction. &nbsp;A lot of your hits will usually be from the same people.<br><br>The instant gratification way would be to pay a fixed amount for each near-hit immediately, and the operator takes the risk from randomness of having more or less near-hits before a block is found. <br><br>Either way, the user who submits the hit that solves the block should get an extra amount off the top, like 10 BTC.<br><br>New users wouldn't really even need the Bitcoin software. &nbsp;They could download a miner, create an account on mtgox or mybitcoin, enter their deposit address into the miner and point it at anyone's pool server. &nbsp;When the miner says it found something, a while later a few coins show up in their account.<br><br>Miner writers better make sure they never false-positive near-hits.&nbsp; Users will depend on that to check if the pool operator is cheating them. &nbsp;If the miner wrongly says it found something, users will look in their account, not find anything, and get mad at the pool operator.
