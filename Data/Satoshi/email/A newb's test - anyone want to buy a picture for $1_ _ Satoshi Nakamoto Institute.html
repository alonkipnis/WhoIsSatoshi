Yes, it's a technical limitation.&nbsp; Sending by bitcoin address enters the transaction into the network and the recipient discovers it from the network.&nbsp; You don't connect directly with them and they don't have to be online at the time.<br><br>I very much wanted to find some way to include a short message, but the problem is, the whole world would be able to see the message.&nbsp; As much as you may keep reminding people that the message is completely non-private, it would be an accident waiting to happen.<br><br>Unfortunately, ECDSA can only sign signatures, it can't encrypt messages, and we need the small size of ECDSA.&nbsp; RSA can encrypt messages, but it's many times bigger than ECDSA.

The recommended ways to do a payment for an order:<br>1) The merchant has a static IP, the customer sends to it with a comment.<br>2) The merchant creates a new bitcoin address, gives it to the customer, the customer sends to that address. &nbsp;This will be the standard way for website software to do it.<br><br>RSA vs ECDSA: it's not the size of the executable but the size of the data. &nbsp;I thought it would be impractical if the block chain, bitcoin addresses, disk space and bandwidth requirements were all an order of magnitude bigger. &nbsp;Also, even if using RSA for messages, it would still make sense to do all the bitcoin network with ECDSA and use RSA in parallel for only the message part. &nbsp;In that case, everything that's been implemented up to now would be implemented exactly as it has been.<br><br>We can figure out the best way to do this much later. &nbsp;It could use a separate (maybe existing) e-mail or IM infrastructure to pass messages, and instead of RSA, maybe just put a hash of the message in the transaction to prove that the transaction is for the order described in the message. &nbsp;The message would have to include a salt so nobody could brute force the hash to reveal a short message.
