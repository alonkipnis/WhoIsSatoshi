It looks like we're through with the worst of the Internet<br>connection issues.  0.1.3 fixed a problem where your node's<br>communications could go dead after a while.  The network is<br>running much more smoothly now with this version. <br><br>If you've successfully generated a block, you've seen it has a<br>maturation countdown before you can spend it.  Once it matures,<br>the Credit column will change from 0.00 to 50.00.  For a block to<br>be valid, it has to be broadcasted to the network and get into the<br>block chain, which is why Generate does not run if you're not<br>connected.  If you generated a block without being connected, the<br>network wouldn't know about it and would continue building the<br>chain without it, leaving it behind, and the maturation countdown<br>would change to "(not accepted)" when your node sees that it<br>wasn't used.  If you subtract 1 from the status column, that's how<br>many blocks have been chained after yours.<br>
