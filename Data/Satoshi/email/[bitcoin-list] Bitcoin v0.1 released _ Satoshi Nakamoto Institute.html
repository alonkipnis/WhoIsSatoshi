I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using<br>electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it<br>that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party<br>gets cold feet.<br><br>It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points,<br>donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult<br>sites.  Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications<br>for services that could almost be free but not quite.<br><br>It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail.  The send dialog is<br>resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.<br>It's sent directly when it connects.  The recipient doubleclicks<br>on the transaction to see the full message.  If someone famous is<br>getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to<br>have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and<br>give out the IP address on their website.  "Send X bitcoins to my<br>priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally."<br><br>Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their<br>free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge<br>bitcoins for the trial.<br><br>It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.  If<br>enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling<br>prophecy.  Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many<br>applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a<br>website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.
