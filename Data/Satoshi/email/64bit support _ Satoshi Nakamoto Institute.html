I haven't tried compiling 64-bit yet. 64-bit wouldn't make it any faster, since it uses 64-bit numbers in only a few places and SHA-256 is a 32-bit algorithm, but it may be convenient for those running a 64-bit OS. If I get a chance I'll try -m64 and see what the problem is.<br><br>You can run the 32-bit version on 64-bit Linux by installing ia32-libs. &nbsp;(sudo apt-get install ia32-libs) &nbsp;If we made a Debian package, it could automatically pull that in as a dependency.

I committed a fix for 64-bit compile and some fixes to support wxWidgets 2.9.0.<br><br>There was one compile error in serialize.h with min(sizeof()) that I fixed for 64-bit.&nbsp; The rest of the 64-bit compile errors I was getting were in wxWidgets 2.8.9, so I started working on supporting wxWidgets 2.9.0.<br><br>wxWidgets 2.9.0 is UTF-8.&nbsp; We've been using the ANSI version of wxWidgets 2.8.9 in anticipation of wxWidgets UTF-8 support.<br><br>I compiled and ran on 64-bit Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic.<br><br>I think the only bug left is where the status number is mashed up.&nbsp; I'm not sure why, I have to suspect it's a UTF-8 thing, but no idea how that could happen.&nbsp; Haven't looked into it.<br><br>build-unix.txt is updated and two makefiles on SVN:<br>makefile.unix.wx2.8<br>makefile.unix.wx2.9<br><br>Unfortunately there's still no debian package for either version of wxWidgets we use.&nbsp; They only have the wchar ("unicode") version of wxWidgets 2.8, which is a disaster because wchar wxString doesn't convert to std::string.&nbsp; We use either ANSI wxWidgets 2.8, or wxWidgets 2.9.&nbsp; So you still have to get it and build it yourself.<br>
