<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By the late 13<sup>th</sup> century western Europeans had
developed a new culture.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They possessed
a unique combination of the craft skills to make clocks, and more
importantly, growing use of relationships
that benefited from more precise coordination in time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Almost simultaneously, again uniquely, in
the late 13<sup>th</sup> or early 14<sup>th</sup> century these Europeans
started making and using two very different kinds of clocks – the mechanical
clock and the sandglass.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The technology
of the mechanical clock was independent of that of the sandglass, but they
played complementary roles in their function.  As a result they
appeared and were widely used at the same time and place in history.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">From an engineering perspective the mechanical clock with
its novelty, the escapement, was by far the more important invention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In terms of its impact on contemporary
temporal relationships, the mechanical clock and sandglass were of similar
importance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main innovations were
the restructurings of the relationships themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Chief among these was the time-rate wage,
which played a leading role the economic revolution that started in the late
Middle Ages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between the 14<sup>th</sup>
century (by which time the sandglass and mechanical clock had been invented and
the use of the time-rate wage was accelerating) and the 19<sup>th</sup> century
(when slavery and serfdom finally disappeared in the <st1:place>First World</st1:place>)
occurred the most rapid transformation of economic institutions in human
history.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During this era physically
coerced labor gave way to worker choice; serfdom and slavery succumbed to the
time-rate wage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First with the bell
towers, then with their new clocks, Europeans measured with increasing accuracy
and integrity the quantity of a most basic human quality – the sacrifices we
make for each other.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Long before the 13<sup>th</sup> century, the time of day was
important to Europeans.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Rome</st1:place></st1:city>
was filled with sundials, and medieval <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>’s bell
towers were the tallest structures in their towns.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That most common unit of value in custom and
contract, the main measure of sacrifice, the day, was carved into smaller
chunks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Bell</st1:place></st1:city>
towers aurally subdivided the day that the sky visually delimited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mechanical clock and the sandglass greatly
improved this accounting of sacrifice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With
better clocks an hour’s worth, or precisely a day’s worth, of labor specified
in a work agreement could now be securely verified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other relationships as well could be
coordinated -- a meeting, an inspection, an auction, the time for opening a
market could be planned with far less time wasted waiting for lagging
participants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Fair broadcast and verification of time was thus of
fundamental importance to the most common contractual relationship in the new
European cities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In agricultural
societies, including medieval Europe, serfdom and slavery had provided most of
the labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Most workers in a modern
economy earn wages based on a time rate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Along with or following the rise of the <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>time-rate institution -- including the
contracts themselves, the laws and regulations governing the contracts, and the
technology to fairly measure the principal quantity – came the growth of
related economic institutions, such as the joint stock company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These institutions enabled a boom in productivity
and the spectacular rise of <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> from its darkest ages
to the modern era.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We will now chart
the rise of the clocks and the institutions they supported.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<h3>Ancient Time</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Artemidorus wrote in the second century A.D. about how to
interpret dreams involving clocks: “A clock signifies occupations and
undertakings, movements and the start of transactions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Men keep their eyes on the time in all that they
do.” [4]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Two centuries earlier Plautus,
a comic writer of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Roman</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Republic</st1:placename></st1:place>,
had a idler (a “parasite”, a perpetual welfare case) character cry out against
responsibility as measured by time[5]:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“The gods
confound the man who first found out</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How to
distinguish the hours.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Confound him too,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who in this
place set up a sundial,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To cut and
hack my days so wretchedly</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Into small
pieces!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When I was a boy,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My belly
was my sundial – only surer,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Truer, and
more exact than any of them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This dial
told me when ‘twas the proper time</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To go to
dinner, when I ought to eat;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
nowadays, why even when I have,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I can’t
fall to unless the sun gives leave.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The town’s
so full of these confounded dials!”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Plautus’ idler cried out not against the sun, but rather against
the use of the sun, instead of the claims of his own desires, as a shared
measure of when shared events should occur.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The sundials would also have let the idler’s peers know just how much of
their day they sacrificed while he dozed and whined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Cosmic
events have a crucial integrity property – they occur independently of the
manipulation of humans.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The movements of sun, moon, and stars are also
reliable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They thus served as a fair
standard of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There did remain the problem that some of the natural events
were sometimes open to interpretation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Clouds could obscure the sky, hastening dusk, delaying dawn, botching
sundial readings, and obliterating the stars.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Rules for the start of work might
include such factors as, “as soon as you can recognize the denomination of a
coin at arm’s length”, or “as soon as you can recognize a face at three paces.”
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A commonly used pre-dawn event was the
crow of a rooster --not always reliable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Yet another problem, worse the
farther north you get, was that the length of sun hours varied with the time of
year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Despite these problems, the fair cycles of nature – in those
days, the movements of the sun, moon, and stars; in our day the quantum
vibrations of cesium or the pulse of a pulsar – have always served as the
ultimate authoritative standard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Observing, and even more importantly communicating this time, is another
matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We need to synchronize our commitments
and activities with measures both reliable from error and secure from strategic
tampering.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We shall now see how the
technologies and institutions for such synchronization developed further with
the spread of technologies to both independently measure the
time and to broadcast a standard version of the time.  These
technologies revolutionized human relationships.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;color:black"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<h3>Commercial Law and the <st1:place><st1:placename>Italian</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Republics</st1:placetype></st1:place></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The economic tyranny of the late Roman Empire had left a
devastated polity, a culture in Western Europe that had lost its knowledge of
civilized commercial practice and accustomed to seeing government not as a
source of any productive assistance to commerce, but only a destroyer of
commerce from which commerce must hide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The highly evolved commercial laws and institutions of the Phoenicians,
Carthaginians, Greeks, and early Romans were forgotten, starvation gutted the
population, economy degenerated to poverty, and civilization died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the <st1:place>Eastern Empire</st1:place>,
now <st1:city><st1:place>Byzantium</st1:place></st1:city>, retained a chokehold
on East-West trade and only slowly declined, the <st1:place>Western Empire</st1:place>
disappeared into the dark ages with its takeover by the illiterate German
tribes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Up to, in some cases, the 20th century, ruins, in stone and
text, of the Roman Empire struck the imagination of power seeking warriors, and
they tried to re-impose the empire from the top down – calling themselves
“emperor”, “Caesar” (Tsar, Kaiser), etc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This was the main political impulse during <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>’s
dark ages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While German kings tried to
re-impose the <st1:place>Roman Empire</st1:place> from the top down, civic life
slowly and fitfully started to re-emerge and reinvent itself in the High Middle
Ages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In many times and places in
Christian Europe, legal decentralization remained in far greater degree than it
had in the Roman or did in the eastern empires.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Centralization, in the form of Eastern-style “kings” and
“Holy Roman Emperors”, accompanied the conversion of German war-leaders to
Christianity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In northern <st1:country-region><st1:place>Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the German Lombard kings imposed a royal tyranny through their network of
customs booths that restricted and taxed commerce.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the 12<sup>th</sup> century, however, a
number of commercial republics – <st1:city><st1:place>Venice</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Genoa</st1:place></st1:city>, and <st1:city><st1:place>Milan</st1:place></st1:city>
foremost among them – had overthrown the tyranny, replacing the <st1:place>Lombard</st1:place>
king with the Lombard League of city republics.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The customs booths were torn down and the
long road back from the Dark ages began.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thus grew, by the 13<sup>th</sup> century in northern <st1:country-region><st1:place>Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
a unique civilization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first
ingredients were the oral, decentralized, rich, and diverse tribal customs of
the Germans.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second ingredients
were the textual remains of the ancient Greek and Roman commercial practices
and their theories of law and local debate, as well as elements added later
when these practices were subjugated under imperial rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The result was a synthesis that married the
more applicable of the ancient practices and theories with the emerging
decentralized legal systems of the Italian republics, to produce new legal codes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Along with these new codes emerged new
commercial institutions that went on to produce the unprecedented abundance and
freedoms, culminating, for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Italy</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
a few hundred years later in the Renaissance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1288 Bonvesin della Riva bragged in writing about the
achievements of his remarkable new civilization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He described the wealth and strength of <st1:city><st1:place>Milan</st1:place></st1:city>,
a city with 1,500 notaries, over a hundred lawyers, 40 copy scribes, 8
professors of grammar, more than a thousand shopkeepers, and 900 mills. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Over 200 bells rang from 120 church towers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Craftsmen made musical instruments, including
mechanically sophisticated organs and bell chimers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More than thirty craft shops alone made
“sweet-sounding brass bells” attached to horses that chimed in time with their
trot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As important to della Riva as <st1:city><st1:place>Milan</st1:place></st1:city>’s
wealth was its security against tyrants -- it could muster over 200,000
men-at-arms from the city and surrounding county.[7]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<h3>Public Goods, Polycentric Law, and the Church</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Much of western Europe during this period enjoyed multiple
sources of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, guilds,
merchants, and other individuals drafting contracts could choose among the urban
communal law, the canon law of the Church, and their own <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Lex Mercatoria. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i>[Ref: Benson, Berman]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The numbers of contracts drafted, as well as
the details and integrity of their contents, were unprecedented in
history.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Typical contracts of the period
waive rights under urban or royal law, which left the default (the merchant’s
own courts, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lex Mercatoria</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One could, alternatively, write into a
contract a “pledge of faith” so that the contract would be covered by canon law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place><st1:placename>Medieval</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>, as a result of this, as
well as of the result of its own production and trade activities, was far more
than a religious institution. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Canon law, like the ringing of bells we will discuss below,
was meant to be a local public service, available only to a surrounding
community that consisted of tithing Catholics.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Another such public service, provided in the early and high Middle Ages
primarily by the Church, but later taken over by municipal and still later by
royal governments, was the keeping of the standard weights and measures, by
which the standard weights and measures used in the markets were audited. [7]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As such, it was most commonly used in local contracts, such
as loans to a permanent resident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
debtor could not pay back the loan, his creditors would present the contract to
the parish priest and ask for an excommunication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such condemnation was a common event, but it
was damaging nevertheless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the town
church, and in the larger towns this could be a looming dark cathedral, the
congregation gathered and listened to the sermon, with the deadbeat separated
out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the sermon the priest from
his pulpit read out the name of the oath-breaker, and denounced him, telling
the townspeople what the excommunication was for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reaching the end of his condemnation, all
the candles in the church were snuffed out, reflecting the new state of the
condemned’s soul.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The bell was tolled,
using the particular sequence and bell used for a funeral.[6]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<img src="./A Measure of Sacrifice_files/BellTowerRonciglione.jpg" align="left">

<p class="MsoNormal">The deadbeat now could not attend church.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If he died while excommunicate, he would be
buried in unconsecrated ground, and would usually believe the doctrine that he
was condemned to hell.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Wroe has
described the penance with which a miscreant in a 14<sup>th</sup> century
French town, after having worked out a revised payback schedule between
himself, his creditors, and his Church – and in monetary terms the Church was
quite lenient -- later won back his soul:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The penitent deadbeat stood in front of the congregation,
“in an unbelted shirt, bareheaded and without his shoes, holding one of the
same thick candles he carried, sometimes, on watch duty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hot wax dribbled down the sides of it to set
on his hand and arm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a while, his
arm ached.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He looked like a man who had
been pulled out of bed and out of some moral torpor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most of the neighbors, sympathetically,
tried not to moralize about this penance, but some did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The longer a man remained excommunicate,
seeming not to care, the more people querie his adherence to his faith as well
as his solvency….Inside the parish, therefore, there was no escaping the
publicity of debt. “ [6]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<h3>Canonical Bells</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In our time, the tallest and most expensive buildings belong
to some of our most important economic institutions – multinational
corporations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The size and expense of
our skyscrapers will provide future archaeologists an important clue that these
institutions played a big role in our economy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the high and late Middle Ages, the tallest structures in <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>
were bell towers --<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>larger and <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>more numerous in that region than on any other
continent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Chartres</st1:place></st1:city>
in the year 1169 boasted a 437 foot tower, the world’s tallest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These towers, besides the churches they were
built upon, were also the most expensive structures in town. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Some historians claim that the size and expense of <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>’s
steeples and public clocks, like the size and expense of the churches they were
built upon, reflected the predominant role of religion in medieval life, as
opposed to business in ours. Given that the churches and cathedrals themselves
were expensive, this is a plausible claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, we have seen that the Church also played a leading role in the
economy, both by its own economic activities and by its role in commercial
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The church bells and their clocks
also played a major economic role.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Telling time was not the only, and perhaps not even
initially the main, function of church towers and their bells. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>An important early function of the bell tower
was as an alarm, to inform the town of emergencies such as a fire or attacking
army.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The towers also sometimes made a
good vantage point to detect such events. They tolled for events such as
baptisms and funerals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Timekeeping
became its primary function, first in order to call people to mass, but soon as
a general service the Church provided to the surrounding Catholic community
that supported it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Long before the mechanical clock, residents
within a few miles of a church started working their schedules around the
canonical hours – sundial-based unequal hours – tolled on its bells.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<img src="./A Measure of Sacrifice_files/BellTowerSundial.jpg" align="right">

<p class="MsoNormal">Thus in many European cities, long before the invention of
the mechanical clock, the local church was trusted to ring the hours.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Churches, funded mainly by the nearby
parishioners, but often also by the city or directly by a guild of merchants,
lavished enormous resources to build, operate, and maintain the towers as well
as the bells, and later for the clocks that were installed in those towers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The productive synchronization of human
relationships funded the bell towers; the bell towers would provide a ready
market for public clocks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus did in <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>
emerge a “virtuous circle” that would advance both its timekeeping technologies
and time-dependent institutions beyond those of the other continents.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The time rung on the bells was mainly read from a sundial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By the 11th century these were often supplemented
by water clocks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the end of the 14<sup>th</sup>
century most were using the new mechanical clock, backed up by another new technology
of that century, the more reliable and personally secure sandglass.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the larger and more important belfries were present at
least two bell-ringers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>They lived up there full-time [4].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This arrangement is an exmaple of the
pattern of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dual control</i> – each ringer
served as a check for the other; neither could spoof the time or other bell
signals without the collusion of both.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The heaviest and most expensive elements of the towers were
the bells.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bells smiths competed to
produce the most distantly hearable ringing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The “Maria Angola” bell, cast in 1659 and
installed in a cathedral in <st1:place><st1:city>Cusco</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Peru</st1:country-region></st1:place>

in 1321, a carillon was installed that played on an array of bells a hymn

prayer, funerals, visiting dignitaries, opening and closing the gates,

<h3>Mechanical Clocks</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries, the expensive
bell towers of <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>’s main cities and towns got a
fancy upgrade – the mechanical clock.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These machines were the high-tech wonders of their day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While most mills were built from wood, from
their first major appearance in the late 13<sup>th</sup> century mechanical
clocks were built from finely crafted iron parts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A very small number of designs for unique water clocks with
sophisticated mechanical parts, including some with regulatory mechanisms
similar to an escapement, are known from earlier times in China and the Islamic
world. They were marvels that showed off their engineers’ prowess. The East’s
clocks were designed and used for no purpose other than mimicking the cosmos in
gears.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They were nice for esoteric
research and entertainment. They were not widely built and thus clocks did not,
until developed further by the Europeans, transform human relationships like
they did in <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The key engineering breakthrough giving rise to the
mechanical clock was the escapement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This breakthrough may have derived from one or more of at least four
potential sources: the earlier escapement-like water clocks of <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
alarm clocks, musical instruments, or the technological ideals of craftsmen and
engineers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Monks, soldiers, and merchants alike often needed to arise
with an alarm more reliable than the rooster’s call.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Water
clocks were expensive to build and operate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the ringing alarm sounds better when it is regular.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A compelling case has been made[4] that the
escapement developed out of the regular alarm ringing mechanism, and fulfilled
the need of a clock that would run overnight unattended and produce an alarm in
the morning, more reliably and cheaply than a water clock.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Among the musical instruments of 13<sup>th</sup> century <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>
was a circular turntable of bells, each tuned to a different note.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At some point, around or before the
invention of the mechanical clock, these became automated in the form of a
carillon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As with the alarm clock,
early mechanisms to induce regular chiming from the carillon resembled the
early escapements of European mechanical clocks.[4]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Two technological ideals arose from the rapidly growing mill
industries of high medieval <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> and the corresponding
professional craftsmen who designed, built, and operated them. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first ideal was the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">automata, </i>the goal of mimicking life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Today this goal is still alive and well, in
the form of robotics and artificial intelligence. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The second ideal was the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">perpetuum mobile, </i>the goal of achieving unending motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One inspiration of this ideal was the
movement of water mills, which (if designed well enough) would never ceased as
long as the water flowed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also
inspiring were the movements of the moon, sun, and stars – “machines” that ran
on their own, cycling, so it seemed, for eternity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ideal of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">perpetuum mobile</i> is not today popular, because it became confused
with the ideal of a source requiring no energy, which 19<sup>th</sup> century
thermodynamics showed to be impossible. However, reducing friction, noise, and
other obstacles to smooth motion are still important objectives for mechanical
engineers. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.0in"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>
<img src="./A Measure of Sacrifice_files/BellClocks.JPG" align="right">

<p class="MsoNormal">Early public mechanical clocks were also (or even mainly)
works of art that both demonstrated the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">perpetuum
mobile</i> ideal – specific mimicry of the sun, moon, and stars in a mill-like
machine, and the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">automata</i> ideal, in
the form of parades of crowing cocks, bowing Magi, and a variety of other
life-like creations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The technological
breakthrough, the escapement, provided the “heartbeat” of these automata while
also allowing the long-lived mimicry of the regular movements of the cosmos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A negotiation can have many possible outcomes, some of them
more likely than others.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The most likely
of these are called “focal points” (also “Schelling points”, after their
discoverer).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Focal points are often
designed and submitted into negotiations by one side or another, both to bias
the negotiations and to reduce their cost. The fixed price at the supermarket
(instead of haggling), the prewritten contract the appliance salesman presents
you, etc. are examples of hard focal points. They are simply agreed to right
away; they serve as the end as well as the beginning of negotiations, because
haggling over whether the nearest neighbor focal point is better is too
expensive for both parties. </p>

<p>There are many weak enforcement mechanisms which also serve a similar
purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contemporary examples include
the little arms in parking garages that prevent you from leaving without
paying, the sawhorses and tape around construction sites, most fences, etc. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Violation is easy to do but also easy to
see.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Civilization is filled with these implicit
contracts, enforced more by custom than by strong security or integrity, and embedded
in the world. </p>

<p>More subtle examples include taxi meters, cash register readouts, computer
displays, and so on. As with hard focal points, the cost of haggling is reduced
by invoking technology as authority. "I'm sorry, but that's what the
computer says", argue clerks around the world. "I know I estimated
$50 to get to <st1:city><st1:place>Manhattan</st1:place></st1:city>, but the
meter reads $75", says the taxi driver. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The parties may assume the machine works
fairly, implicitly or explicitly trusting its maker and/or its operator.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
machine is perceived by its users to have some property of relentlessness, or
the inability of at least the immediate users to undetectably tamper with
it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If the mechanism can in fact be
tampered,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the parties either come to
distrust it and move to some other method of verifying their agreement, or they
use their own means or a reputable third party auditor, for example the city
taxi inspector, too verify the operation of the machine.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The first public clocks, built with great expense and hype,
served as such authoritative automata.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were explicitly linked to, and drew on,
the relentlessly fair timekeeping of the sun, moon, and stars. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was not long, however, before the
listeners to bells learned that mechanical clocks on the vulgar earth, unlike
their cosmic counterparts in heaven, could be fudged, reset, or spoofed by the
sinful humans who operated them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In one 15<sup>th</sup> century bell tower
the expensive mechanical clock broke down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Instead of fixing it, the clock was replaced by two ringers using sandglasses.[4]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We’ll have more to say about the integrity --
the security and fairness -- of public mechanical clocks, and of timekeeping in
general, below.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The mechanical clock, and especially its key breakthrough
the escapement, are much more important than the sandglass from our point of
view.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For contemporaries, however, the
sandglass was equally or more important.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Until the widespread use of small table-top mechanical clocks, the
sandglass was the primary means of fair timekeeping.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sandglass was visible to all in a room,
and it could only be dramatically and obviously “reset”, it couldn’t be fudged
like a mechanical clock.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The accuracy of early mechanical clocks, plus or minus 10-15
minutes per day, was not substantially better than that of late water clocks,
and was less accurate than the contemporary sandglass.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That mechanical clocks nevertheless spread
widely in the fourteenth century may be attributed to (a) its automatic
striking feature, which allowed the clock to be struck every hour at lower
cost, providing about three times as much granularity with which to schedule
events – or six times, where the half-hours were struck, or twelve times where
striking quarter hours, (b) the cost of operating a mechanical clock was lower
than a water clock, (c) the need, caused by the advent of sandglass reckoning,
to augment the sandglass with a longer-term and widely and fairly broadcast
equal-hour standard, and (d) the moral authority derived from mimicking the
independent, fair movements in the cosmos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Before the mechanical clock, bell towers used the old system
of canonical hours, with some untoward consequences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the striking was manual, it was
usually done only four times during daylight and once at night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The none (“ninth hour”) was originally rung
at roughly (what we now call) <st1:time hour="15" minute="0">3 p.m.</st1:time>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the Middle Ages it wandered back and
forth, finally migrating back through the day until it reached its current
spot, <st1:time hour="12" minute="0">noon</st1:time>, in the twelfth
century.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This may have occurred because
lunch (or the breaking of fast on certain holy days) was scheduled for none,
but the monks tended to get hungry before then.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>It may have occurred in the
service of laborers who got off work at none instead of sundown, although there
weren’t very many of these lucky workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Any such incentive would operate like a ratchet – errors forward caused
hungry stomachs or aching bones and so were corrected; errors backwards tended
to be ignored and accumulate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
migration natural occurred at very different speeds at different
localities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Different regions were not
fully synchronized until long after clock hours had replaced the canonical
hours.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Even with the advent of the mechanical clock, its most fair
and secure property was not that it told time more accurately – its accuracy
slipped by several minutes per day, and the monks or prelates had to be trusted
to not reset it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The secure fairness
of the bell tower’s broadcast was the most valuable component of the system.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the mechanical clock’s improvement
in accuracy from up to an hour, to only a few minutes, still greatly increased
the ability to coordinate and reduced disputes over, for example, daily work
times.</p>

<h3>Sandglasses</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">An advancing technology in 13<sup>th</sup> century western
Europe very different from mechanics was glass-blowing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The origin of the sandglass is quite
obscure, but its accuracy relies on a precise ratio between the neck width and
the grain diameter.  It thus required extensive trial and error
for glass-blowers to arrive at hour glasses for sand, ground marble, eggshell,
and other sized grains, and techniques for mass producing these precisely sized
works of glass, besides a ready of market of users, which <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>
turned out to be.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There are no demonstrated cases of sandglasses before the 14<sup>th</sup>
century.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Manufacture and use of the
sand-glass was widespread in western Europe by the middle of the 14<sup>th</sup>
century.[10]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1339 Ambrosio
Lorenzetti painted a fresco in Siena, one of the commercial cities of northern
Italy, which shows a sandglass as an allegory for temperance (self-control). <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mariners in the <st1:place>Mediterranean</st1:place>
were likely using sandglasses to measure time and velocity by 1313.
By 1394 French housewives were using recipes
to make, along with food, glue, ink, and so on, marble grains for an
hour-glass:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">"Take the grease which comes from the sawdust of marble
when those great tombs of black marble be sawn, then boil it well in wine like
a piece of meat and skim it, and then set it out to dry in the sun; and boil,
skim and dry nine times; and thus it will be good."&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Such a recipe presumably creates grains of a size in a
precise ratio to a standard hour-glass neck size, thus producing an accurate
time.”[10]<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The sandglass, not the mechanical clock, became between the 13<sup>th</sup>
and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries the main European timekeeper in activities as
diverse as public meetings, sermons, and academic lectures.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was also the main navigational and scientific
clock during that period.[4,10]</p>

<h3>A Measure of Sacrifice</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The most important institutional breakthrough that accompanied the clock,
the time-rate wage, was based on a largely implicit idea that grew with the
invention of the clock – the idea of time as a measure of sacrifice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Mechanical clocks, bell towers, and sandglasses provided the
world’s first fair and fungible measure of sacrifice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So many of the things we sacrifice for are
not fungible, but we can arrange our affairs around the measurement of the
sacrifice rather than its results.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Merchants
and workers alike used the new precision of clock time to prove, brag, and
complain about their sacrifices.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In a letter from a fourteenth-century Italian merchant to
his wife, Francesco di Marco Ganti invokes the new hours tell her of the
sacrifices he is making: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>“tonight, in the
twenty-third hour, I was called to the college,” and, “I don’t have any time,
it is the twenty-first hour and I have had nothing to eat or drink.” [4]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Like
many cell phone callers today, he wants to reassure her that he is spending the
evening working, not wenching.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A major application of clocks was to schedule meeting
times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Being a city official was an
expected sacrifice as well as a source of political power.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To measure the sacrifice, as well as to
coordinate more tightly meeting times, the modern clocks of the fourteenth
century came in handy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some regulations
of civic meetings of this period point up that that measuring the sacrifice was
important, regardless of the variable output of the meetings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In Nuremburg, the Commission of Five “had to
observe the sworn minimum meeting time of four “or” (hours) per day, regardless
of whether or not they had a corresponding workload. They were also obliged to
supervise their own compliance by means of a sandglass.[4]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<h3>Time-Rate Wages</h3>

more fraud opportunities</p>
-->

<p class="MsoNormal">As commerce grew, more quantities need their value to be measured, leading to more complications and more opportunities for fraud.  Measurement disputes become too frequent when
measuring too many quantities.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Measuring value is hard.  Measuring something
that actually indicates value is harder.  Measuring something
related to value and immune to spoofing is hardest
of all.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Most workers in the modern economy earn money based on a
time rate -- the hour, the day, the week, or the month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In agricultural societies slavery, serfdom,
and piece rates were more common than time-rate wages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Time measures input rather than output.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Time is the main way we arrange our affairs
around the measurement of the sacrifice rather than its results.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<img src="./A Measure of Sacrifice_files/notar_300px.jpg" align="left">

<p class="MsoNormal">To create anything of value requires some sacrifice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To successfully contract we must measure
value.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since we can’t, absent a perfect
exchange market, directly measure the economic value of something, we may be
able to estimate it indirectly by measuring something else.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This something else anchors the performance
– it gives the performer an incentive to optimize the measured value.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Which measures are the most appropriate
anchors of performance?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Starting in <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>
by the 13<sup>th</sup> century, that measure was increasingly a measure of the
sacrifice needed to create the desired economic value.
</p><p>
This is hardly automatic – labor is not value.
A bad artist can spend years doodling, or a
worker can dig a hole where nobody wants a hole.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arbitrary amounts of time could be spent on
activities that do not have value for anybody except, perhaps, the worker
himself. To improve the productivity of the time rate contract required two
breakthroughs: the first, creating the conditions under which sacrifice is a better
estimate of value than piece rate or other measurement alternatives, and second,
the ability to measure, with accuracy and integrity, the sacrifice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Three of the main alternatives to time-rate wages are
eliminating worker choice (i.e., serfdom and slavery), commodity market
exchange, and piece rates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
eliminating choice, masters and lords imposed high exit costs, often in the
form of severe punishments for escape, shirking, or embezzlement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Serfs
were usually required to produce a particular quantity of a good (where the
good can be measured, as it often can in agriculture) to be expropriated by the
lord or master. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Serfs kept for their
personal use (not for legal trade) either a percentage or the marginal output,
i.e. the output above and beyond what they owed, by custom or coercion, to
their lord.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Where quantity was not a good measure of value, close
observation and control were kept over the laborer, and the main motivator was
harsh punishments for failure. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>High
exit costs also provided the lord with a longer-term relationship, thus over
time the serf or slave might develop a strong reputation for trustworthiness
with the lord. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The undesirability of
servitude, from the point of view of the laborer at least, is obvious. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Serfs and slaves faced brutal work conditions,
floggings, starvation, very short life spans, and the inability to escape no
matter how bad conditions got. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Piece rates measure directly some attribute of a good or
service that is important to its value – its quantity, weight, volume, or the
like -- and then fix a price for it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Guild regulations which fixed prices often amounted to creating piece
rates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Piece rates seem the ideal
alternative for liberating workers, but they suffer for two reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the outputs of labor depend not only
on effort, skills, etc. (things under control of the employee), but things out
of control of the employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
employee wants something like insurance against these vagaries of the work
environment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The employer, who has more wealth and
knowledge of market conditions, takes on these risks in exchange for profit.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In an unregulated commodity market, buyers can reject or
negotiate downwards the price of poor quality goods.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sellers can negotiate upwards or decline to
sell. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With piece rate contracts, on the
other hand, there is a fixed payment for a unit of output.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus second main drawback to piece rates is
that they motivate the worker to put out more quantity at the expense of
quality. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This can be devastating.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tendency of communist countries to pay
piece rates, rather than hourly rates, is one reason that, while the Soviet
bloc’s quantity (and thus the most straightforward measurements of economic
growth) was able to keep up with the West, quality did not (thus the contrast,
for example, between the notoriously ugly and unreliable Trabant of East
Germany and the BMWs, Mercedes, Audi and Volkswagens of West Germany).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thus with the time-rate wage the employee is insured against
vagaries of production beyond his control, including selling price fluctuations
(in the case of a market exchange), or variation in the price or availability
of factors of production (in the case of both market exchange or piece
rates).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The employer takes on these
risks, while at the same time through promotion, raises, demotions, wage cuts
or firing retaining incentives for quality employee output.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><br>
<img src="./A Measure of Sacrifice_files/munt.jpg" align="right">

</p><p class="MsoNormal">Besides lacking implicit insurance for the employee, another
limit to market purchase of each worker’s output is that it can be made
prohibitively costly by relationship-specific investments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These investments occur when workers engage
in interdependent production -- as the workers learn the equipment or adapt to
each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relationship-specific
investments can also occur between firms, for example building a cannon foundry
next to an iron mine. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>These investments,
when combine with the inability to write long-term contracts that account for
all eventualities, motivate firms to integrate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing with unspecified eventualities then
becomes the right of the single owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This incentive to integrate is opposed by the diseconomies of scale in a
bureaucracy, caused by the distribution of knowledge, which market exchange
handles much better [13].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>An in-depth discussion of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>economic tradeoffs that produce observed
distributions of firm sizes in a market, i.e. the number of workers involved in
an employment relationship instead of selling their wares directly or working
for smaller firms,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>has been discussed in
[11,12]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The main alternative to market exchange of output, piece
rate, or coerced labor (serfdom or slavery) consists of the employers paying by
sacrifice -- by some measure of the desirable things the employee foregoes to
pursue the employer’s objectives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
hour spent at work is an hour not spent partying, playing with the children,
etc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For labor, this “opportunity cost”
is most easily denominated in time – a day spent working for the employer is a
day not spent doing things the employee would, if not for the pay, desire to do.
[1,9]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Time doesn’t specify costs such as effort and danger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These have to be taken into account by an
employee or his union when evaluating a job offer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Worker choice, through the ability to switch
jobs at much lower costs than with serfdom, allows this crucial quality control
to occur.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It’s usually hard to specify customer preferences, or
quality, in a production contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It’s
easy to specify sacrifice, if we can measure it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Time is immediately observed; quality is
eventually observed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With employment
via a time-wage, the costly giving up of other opportunities, measured in time,
can be directly motivated (via daily or hourly wages), while quality is
motivated in a delayed, discontinuous manner (by firing if employers and/or
peers judge that quality of the work is too often bad).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Third parties, say the guy who owned the shop
across the street, could observe the workers arriving and leaving, and tell
when they did so by the time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Common
synchronization greatly reduced the opportunities for fraud involving that most
basic contractual promise, the promise of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Once pay for time is in place, the basic incentives are in
place – the employee is, verifiably, on the job for a specific portion of the
day – so he might as well work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He might
as well do the work, both quantity and quality, that the employer
requires.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With incentives more closely
aligned by the calendar and the city bells measuring the opportunity costs of
employment, to be compensated by the employer, the employer can focus
observations on verifying the specific quantity and qualities desired, and the
employee (to gain raises and avoid getting fired) focuses on satisfying
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So with the<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>time-wage contract, perfected by northern and
western Europeans in the late Middle Ages, we have two levels of the protocol
in this relationship: (1) the employee trades away other opportunities to
commit his time to the employer – this time is measured and compensated,
(2)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the employer is motivated, by
(positively) opportunities for promotions and wage rate hikes and (negatively)
by the threat of firing, to use that time, otherwise worthless to both employer
and employee, to achieve the quantity and/or quality goals desired by the
employer.[1]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Time-rate employment provides a major productivity
improvement </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">over servitude or (usually) piece rates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Time-rate contracts however require a
reliable and secure -- a fair and independent -- source of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Laborers were, even before the advent of the
clock, commonly paid by the day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
how long is a “day”?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It couldn’t be
just daylight hours;<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>this makes for a
longer workday than employer and employer might otherwise agree to, and in
northern latitudes it varies quite substantially within a year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the rather heterogeneous measures of
time, employer could cheat the employee out of hours, or vice versa, unless
they had a securely independent standard of time.</p>

<h3>A Dispute over Time</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Dorhn-van Rossum[4] describes a remarkable 14<sup>th</sup>
century French legal dispute between vineyard owners and workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case illustrates several points.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First, it shows how many of the practices of
serfdom, including regulation by custom or royal edict rather than by
negotiation between worker and employer, were carried over from serfdom to wage
labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both the wage and working time of
these workers were regulated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Second, it
illustrates the kind of dispute that could arise with the unequal canonical
hours that were rung ambiguously and less often than the mechanical hours.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reliance on the canonical ringing had been
required when workers tried to negotiate a working day different from sunup
until sundown.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, this case shows
why the clock ringers needed to be trusted by both workers and employers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hours rung falsely in a given day led
workers to measure the sun for themselves, using a quadrant or their own shadow
against a fixed size object.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hours that
moved over the years, like the wandering none, had the effect that by keeping
to the same customary start and end bells, the actual amount of work changed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1392, the vineyard owners sought and received a royal
ordinance for Auxerre and nearby areas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This new law specified the longer sunup to sundown hours that the
burghers desired and set a maximum wage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Soon thereafter workers who refused to follow the new regulations were
arrested.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Royal delegates came to
Auxerre to hear the dispute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Both parties had problems defining the work day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The laborers argued that the custom of ending
the work day at none, rather than at sundown, violated the custom of ending
work in the afternoon, which was “so old that nobody could remember it every
having been otherwise.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The working day
ended earlier because the heavy soil made for intense work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Furthermore,
none in Auxerre was now being rung later than in previous years, “between the
fourth and fifth hour of the afternoon instead of the third.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the workers were correct, the shifting of
none to <st1:time hour="12" minute="0">noon</st1:time>, completed in most other
places by 1300, had not yet occurred in Auxerre, and in fact had moved in the
other direction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dohr-van Rossum
continues his description:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.7in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.3in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">the
workers expressed their objection with the help of the new system of reference,
[mechanical] clock time, which had long since become established in
Auxerre.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only open question is thus
how they knew that in the past None had been rung much earlier.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.7in">The burghers countered that they
faced poor yields and high costs, denied that the shorter work day was
customary, and lamented that the royal ordinance was not being enforced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They added a very serious charge – that the<span style="font-size:11.0pt"> workers had tried to incite a revolt like the 1372 peasant
uprisings and tax revolts in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Paris</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="font-size:11.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Dohr-van
Rossum adds:<span style="font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.7in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.3in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.7in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.3in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">The
burghers drew a clear picture of purposeful reduction of working time that the
workers had pursued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At first they had
worked to the end of the ringing of None.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Then they had left at the beginning of the ringing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Currently they were ceasing work with the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cliquet</i>, the pre-signal to the actual
ringing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And when the ringing came late
in the judgment of the workers, they decided to end the work freely according
to the position of the sun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All told
they were now working little more than half a day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The historical argumentation by the burghers
has flaws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As shown by the draft of the
complaint, they were not at all agreed when the workers did in fact cease
working in the afternoon. We hear “two hours”, “two and a half hours”, “three
and a half hours”, (sometimes with “approximately” added), and finally “long
before sundown”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We see here a transition state between serfdom and wage
labor – wage laborers regulated as if they were serfs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The negotiating flexibility of these day
laborers was greatly reduced by regulating the workday and the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">maximum </i>wage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why did the royal bureaucrats pretend they knew
as much or more about such matters than the owners and workers?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Intervention by parties higher in the feudal
hierarchy had often been required to regulate and control the life-long relationships
between serf and lord, lest on the one hand the output available to the lords
be reduced, or on the other hand the lords become so oppressive that peasant rebellion,
despite its futility in most cases, arose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The political and legal forms and customs that regulated serfdom were often
carried over to wage labor, especially where the economy of the jurisdiction,
as with royal <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region>
here, was still dominated by serfdom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
the European economy matured, in fits and starts, over the next few centuries
such disputes would increasingly be solved by negotiations between the most knowledgeable
and interested parties, the owners and workers themselves, and put in the form
of time-rate wage contracts.</p>

<h3>Abstract Events</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In many towns and cities of Medieval Europe, schedules were
set by negotiations between guilds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
schedules definitions were crude.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
common was sunup or sundown.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">For agriculture, the work day of sunup to sundown worked
well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Every major culture working the
land worked this long day. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The start and
end times could be verified with integrity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The day was longest in the summer when the demand for work was
greatest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The drawback of this strong
focal point is that in most cases it excluded the possibility of many alternatives,
especially the ability to negotiate a shorter work day in order to moonlight,
work on personal projects, or gain time for leisure or family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also left open for dispute the length of
breaks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So dominant was the sunup to sundown
tradition that it was often also applied to urban workers, for whom it is far
less in keeping with the work demands of their industries.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Since the canonical hours might be rung only four times per
day, a custom schedule required a custom set of bells, along with a fair,
audited bell ringer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Cities turned into a cacophony of bells signifying the
starts and ends of various events and work schedules [4].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Public mechanical clocks, and especially
their feature for automatically striking each hour, twenty-four hours per day, allowed
for a separation of duties between time-keeping and the planning or scheduling
of specific events.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a “level of
indirection”, as a computer scientist would put it, this allowed for an
explosion of diversity in the daily schedule while decreasing the conflict of
the bells to simply a matter of accuracy in striking the hour.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Some useful integrity properties of old methods were
lost.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sunup, sundown, “the time it
takes to walk across town”, etc. were independently and inexpensively verifiable
events or periods.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clock time depended
on the security of the clock-room and the faithfulness of the clock wardens,
the guys with the keys to the clock-room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The clock warden was a fiduciary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The clock wardens of 16<sup>th</sup> century Augsburg, for example, had
to swear the following oath: “You will swear a learned oath to God and the
saints to faithfully regulate, keep, and maintain the clock of the city day and
night, with everything that goes with it, and also to faithfully guard and lock
the keys to city hall and the clock, including locking and unlocking, also to
be faithful to the city and to warn of harm, all this faithfully and without
guile.”</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the other hand, people were already and increasingly
relying on bell-ringers to ring specific events. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Separation of duties between the timekeeper
and scheduler, and the automated striker, combined with a locked clock-room, reduced
the opportunity and incentive for bell ringer fraud.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rather than resetting the schedule of a
specific event that they were familiar with and responsible for, they would be
resetting the time for a wide variety of events, with a resulting variety of
consequences, and a variety of incentives for the affected parties to verify
the time by independent means. 
Abstract time allowed
different kinds of workers, and even different individuals, more flexibility to
set verifiable working hours different from the naturally verifiable times of
sunup and sundown.</p>

<h3>Equal Hours</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Since the common simple sandglass measured only equal hours,
not canonical hours, it encouraged the use of equal rather than canonical hours
in the new public mechanical clocks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
public clock hours were mostly heard in the ringing, not seen in the dial, and
a mechanism for ringing the variable hours is devilishly difficult -- this also
encourage the adoption of equal hours.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is possible, as was done with some early clocks in <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>,
and when the mechanical clock was introduced into <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
to add simple mechanisms and dial marks that allow a mechanical clock to
display variable hours – but making a clock automatically ring the variable
hours is hard.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The equal hour system operated at two levels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the public level, a mechanical clock
would ring each equal hour.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the
personal or decentralized level, the sandglass would both measure time within
an hour and provide a check against the still-common instances of public clock
unreliability and fraud.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

</p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Clock hours, equal and relatively accurate, began to replace
the unequal (twelve hours in daylight regardless of the length of day) and
heterogeneous canonical hours in contracts, laws, and other institutions,
starting before 1330, and had mostly replaced the canonical hours by 1370.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The historian Jean Froissart shifted from
canonical hours to the new clock hours around 1380.</p>

<h3>The Rise of the Time-Rate Wage and the Decline of Serfdom</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Expensive public clocks spread to many European towns and
cities in the 14<sup>th</sup> century.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What did the Europeans of the time have to say about their costly new
clocks?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The city of <st1:city><st1:place>Caen</st1:place></st1:city>
in 1314 installed a clock with the following inscription:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“I give the hours voice/to make the common
folk rejoice.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While regimentation has
its downsides, getting rid of the stress from disputes over the basic issue of
what time it is – Artemesia is angry with Bassanio for being late, Bassanio
retorts he was early – seemed to bring a great relief and rejoicing to
Europe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A fifteenth century petition for
a city clock for Lyons declared, “If such a clock were to be made, more
merchants would come to the fairs, the citizens would be very consoled,
cheerful and happy and would live a more orderly life, and the town would gain
in decoration.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the 16<sup>th</sup>
century, European cities were so well synchronized that Rabelais could state “a
city without bells is like a blind man without a stick.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The clock and the bells it chimed
synchronized the relations among men.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The productivity of <st1:place>Europe</st1:place> greatly
increased over this period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
productivity can be estimated by measuring how it was consumed, including:</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo7;tab-stops:list .5in">Increasing
     the ecological carrying capacity, and thus the population (except as
	offset by plagues)
 </li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo7;tab-stops:list .5in">A vast
     increase in the quantity, quality, and variety of goods and services
     beyond basic foods,</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo7;tab-stops:list .5in">Shortening
     of the work day and work week.</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.7in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.3in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<h3>Conclusion<o:p></o:p></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Clock time is a fungible measure of sacrifice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of all measurement instruments, the clock is
the most valuable because so many of the things we sacrifice to create are not
fungible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The massive clock towers of <st1:place>Europe</st1:place>,
with their enormous loud and resonant bells, broadcasting time fairly across
the town and even the countryside, rather than the last relics of the medieval,
were the first building block of the wealthy modern world.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Europeans evolved their institutions and
deployed two very different but complementary timekeeping devices, the
sandglass and the mechanical clock, to partition the day into frequently rung
and equal hours.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Europe</st1:place>
progressed in a virtuous circle where bells and clocks improved the
productivity of relationships; the resulting wealthy institutions in turn
funded more advances in timekeeping.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The rise of the cities and the merchant revolution was given
a temporary setback by the Black Plague, the very century that the clock was
introduced, but thereafter economic growth renewed with unprecedented vigor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The massive change on the farm, the dominant
form of industry, in the 14<sup>th</sup> and successive centuries from serfdom
and slavery to markets and wage labor, was caused not only by the temporary
labor shortages of the Black Plague,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>but
more fundamentally and permanently by the time-rate contract and the new
ability to accurately and fairly verify its crucial measurement of sacrifice,
time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Time rates also became the most
common relationship for the mines, mills, factories, and other industries that
rapidly grew after the advent of the clock.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
