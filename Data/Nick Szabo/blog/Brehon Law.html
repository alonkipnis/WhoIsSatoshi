<h3>Brehon Law </h3>

The Brehon law of Ireland lasted from pre-Roman times until the 
1600's.  Our primary interest is in the
relatively isolated era preceeding the Viking invasions. 
</p><p>
The Brehons were travelling judges and lawyers who had undergone
extensive training.   Like ancient Germanic law, a tort-like system of 
fines replaced criminal law, and the entire legal system was, relative to
continental and modern legal systems, decentralized and competitive 
both in terms of both adjudication and enforcement.  "Kings" 
were often more powerful than other persons both in their ability to hire 
Brehons and their ability to enforce Brehon edicts (or defy them).  The 
law also recognized different classes of law based on property
ownership -- the most commonly applied class of law being the 
"Fenechas", the law of the free tillers.  However, the system did 
not have a legislative nor executive branch.  The system was very 
much intermingled with sacred ritual.
</p><p>

I will briefly discuss some interesting aspects of the commercial law.
Contracts ("cor") were based on "mutual understanding, mutual
agreement, mutual consent, and surety given".  Mutual agreement required
"nothing hidden...no malicious intent...no coercion".  Surety came in
three forms:
</p><pre>(1) Naidn: Oath pledging one's honor (reputation)
(2) Aitire: Oath pledging one's freedom
(3) Rath: Surety given by a third party of types (1) or (2)
</pre>

Presumably most monetary damages were based on an underlying
type (2) pledge, the potential to lose one's personal freedom (i.e. 
exposure to legal physical force), although "face" in one's
tauth (extended family to four generations) plaid such a large
role that it probably also incentivized obeying a fine.
<p>

For Aitire a particular third party, with a good reputation as 
an enforcer, was agreed to by the principles.  Rather than being 
assumed any time significant mutual business promises were made (as in 
English and Continental law), the ability to invoke physical 
enforcement was an optional part of the contract and had to be an 
explicit part of the agreement to have force of law. This may 
have greatly reduced invocation of and dependence on physical 
force to incentivize remedy, which may be more efficient in a 
decentralized and competitive law system.
</p><p>

I also found a wonderful bankruptcy procedure.
The idea of a "withe-tie" corresponds loosely
to my idea of a "smart lien".  The "withe-tie" is
some kind of visible band tied around the debtors'
tools.  Also "if a Bard or physician is the debtor
immobilize his horse whip for both ride their circuits".
Since this is largely symbolic, the debtor is on 
honor to not remove the withe-tie, and thus to do
no work, until the debt is paid.
</p><p>

In my version, taking advantage of computer controlled
machinery (most capital equipment now takes this form),
a "smart withe-tie" could literally shut down the machinery. 
However, I find the law as described too harsh.  I would
let the debtor operate the machinery.  My protocol would
rather enforce that any revenues gained via the activity
should go to the creditor first; if any revenues beyond
the most essential costs are instead retained
by the debtor then the machinery is turned off.  In my 
interpretation a withe-tie would not have shut down
the tool but rather indicated that the tool was dedicated
to the sole purpose of paying off the creditor.
</p><p>

My hi-tech "withe-tie" is something of a departure from my 
discussion of Brehon law proper, but you can see why I have found 
the Brehon law system to be a valuable source for constructing the 
law of the coming digital millenium.

My thanks to Eileen O'Connor, J.D. for introducing
me to this wonderful resource.
