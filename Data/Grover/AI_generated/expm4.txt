Why Bitcoin is a great investment

Bitcoin isn’t a great investment because it’s pure speculation.

There’s no set dividend policy in place for Bitcoin, unlike standard stocks. And speculators — say, someone trading a stock index — aren’t looking to lose money. They’re trying to make money. For bitcoin, I’m back to my original point: There’s only one commonality between stock and Bitcoin: they are widely traded.

Anyway, the majority of the index gains were due to the price rises that happened in 2011 and 2012. There’s a key difference between those fluctuations and the price increases we’ve seen in 2014: Investors were dumping a bitcoin for about a fifth more than it was worth earlier in the year. The underlying fluctuations are random, but for the most part, the price moves over the short term fluctuate too much to create a good investment case.

For the value of an investment, your goal should be to increase its price. But only time will tell if this phenomenon of putting a tenth of a bitcoin up for sale to buy it back for 10 times more (so-called “inverse” selling) is truly bullish, to repeat my original point. For example, you’ll know it’s in overvalued territory if the people trading those coin T-shirts for 25 cents in 2012 are still buying them for 25 cents today. In the meantime, it’s safe to say that bitcoin’s value currently doesn’t suggest it’s an excellent investment. If it keeps trending up, it’ll still be a speculative bubble.

But even if the long-term outlook is bleak, there are reasons to see bitcoin as an investment that still holds some attraction. For one, I think money transferred digitally could move us further away from our dependence on financial institutions, which is a good thing. Second, rather than spreading the pain of monetary contraction across all of us, bitcoin could create an economic advantage for certain industries by becoming the medium of exchange between them.

With that, below is the price of bitcoins traded on the Bitstamp exchange right now.
