  </h1>
	<p>I’ve been accused of being too flippant about increasing the block size limit. This series of blog posts is meant to show that I’m not, that I <strong>have</strong> carefully thought about risks and benefits. I stepped back from the role of lead committer exactly so I would have the time to think about bigger-picture issues like this one. Today I’d like to address, head-on, this argument against changing the one-megabyte blocksize limit:</p>
<blockquote class="short">
<p>Larger-than-one-megabyte blocks have had insufficient testing and/or insufficient research into economic implications and/or insufficient security review of the risks versus benefits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is tough to respond to– there can <strong>always</strong> be more testing or research, especially for a security-critical project like Bitcoin. It is easy to suffer from “analysis paralysis,” and I think the Core Bitcoin project <em>has</em> been suffering from analysis paralysis over the block size issue for at least three years now.</p>

<p>I’m convinced the uncertainty over when or if this will be resolved is harming Bitcoin. If somebody can point me at a successful software technology that went through years and years of debate and research and was not deployed until it was perfect I’d change my mind – the example that immediately comes to my  mind is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" rel="nofollow">Project Xanadu</a> versus the Internet.</p>

<p>I don’t think we should adopt the Silicon Valley mantra of “move fast and break things.” But I do think we need to move– “stay still and watch things break” is just as bad.</p>
