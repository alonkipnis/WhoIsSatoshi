What is Bitcoin?
<p>Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.</p>
<p>For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcoin Core software, see <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/download" rel="nofollow">https://bitcoin.org/en/download</a>, or read the License</h2>
<p>Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See for more
information or see.</p>
<h2>Development Process</h2>
<p>The <code>master</code> branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags">Tags</a> are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.</p>
<p>The contribution workflow is described in <a href="https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>.</p>
<p>The developer <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev" rel="nofollow">mailing list</a>
should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes before working
on a patch set.</p>
<p>Developer IRC can be found on Freenode at #bitcoin-core-dev.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.</p>
<h3>Automated Testing</h3>
<p>Developers are strongly encouraged to write <a href="https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/blob/master/doc/unit-tests.md">unit tests</a> for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: <code>make check</code></p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/blob/master/qa">regression and integration tests</a> of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the <a href="https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/blob/master/qa">test dependencies</a> are installed) with: <code>qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py</code></p>
<p>The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.</p>
<h3>Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing</h3>
<p>Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.</p>
<h2>Translations</h2>
<p>Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
<a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin Core's Transifex page</a>.</p>
<p>Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
<a href="https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/blob/master/doc/translation_process.md">translation process</a> for details on how this works.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.</p>
<p>Translators should also subscribe to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-translators" rel="nofollow">mailing list</a>.</p>
