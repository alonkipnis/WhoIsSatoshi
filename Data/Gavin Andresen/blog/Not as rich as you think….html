	<p>People assume that the people who worked on Bitcoin in the early years are fabulously wealthy.</p>

<p>That’s a bad assumption, for lots of reasons:</p>

<p>It was easy to lose coins. They weren’t worth much, so people didn’t bother to take the time to keep them secure and back them up.</p>

<p>Many of the early developers didn’t have extra money to buy coins; they were still in school, or were pouring all of their money into a startup. Venture capitalists were <strong>NOT</strong> throwing money at Bitcoin startups back in 2010 and 2011.</p>

<p>“HODL” wasn’t a thing– instead, bootstrapping the community by purchasing  things (like 50BTC alpaca socks or 10,000BTC pizzas) or giving away Bitcoin was encouraged.</p>

<p>Even if an early developer had the free cash and foresight to purchase a bunch of coins, they might be level-headed and follow tried and true investment advice to:</p>

<p>1) Make a long-term plan and stick to it, ignoring short-term market drama<br>
2) Diversify; mix high-risk and low-risk investments, and re-balance if any one investment dominates your portfolio.</p>

<p>Imagine a rational, disciplined person who had $100,000 in investments before they heard about Bitcoin. On January 1, 2011 they decided to take a risk and spend five thousand dollars to buy 10,000 BTC. Their long-term plan: evaluate their holdings once a year, and rebalance at the beginning of the year if their BTC holdings were more than 10% of their total investments.</p>

<p>I created <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19fEd6RhNnnnPBfUF_iRv1yvj4ZtV214nBqsFlOe4Ep0/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">a spreadsheet</a> showing what happens. They would do extremely well, ending up with over $5million– a 1,000x return on their initial investment! But they would sell almost all of their BTC along the way, ending up holding fewer than 40 BTC.</p>

<p>Which is nothing to sneeze at; 40 BTC is worth a few hundred thousand dollars, and 5 million dollars in safe, liquid investments is enough to fund a very comfortable retirement.</p>
