Time to roll out bigger blocks</a>
  </h1>
	<p>I was planning to submit a pull request to the 0.11 release of Bitcoin Core that will allow miners to create blocks bigger than one megabyte, starting a little less than a year from now. But this process of peer review turned up a technical issue that needs to get addressed, and I donâ€™t think it can be fixed in time for the first 0.11 release.</p>

<p>I will be writing a series of blog posts, each addressing one argument against raising the maximum block size, or against scheduling a raise right now. These are the objections I plan on writing about; please send me an email if I am missing any arguments for why one megabyte is the best size for Bitcoin blocks over the next few years.</p>


<p>If I am being unfair in how I am stating any of the above objections, please let me know via email.</p>
