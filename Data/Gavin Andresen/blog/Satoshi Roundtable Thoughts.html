  </h1>
	<p>I participated in the “Satoshi Roundtable” event in Florida last weekend on my way home from the <a href="http://fc16.ifca.ai/" rel="nofollow">Financial Cryptography conference</a>.</p>

<p>The Roundtable is an invitation-only event organized by Bruce Fenton (current Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, but it is not a Foundation event), and I’m told that in past years it was mostly a relaxed networking/socializing event.</p>

<p>This year, discussion of the the block size limit dominated the entire weekend.</p>

<p>All of that discussion happened under the “Chatham House Rule” – “…participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed” – so for the rest of this blog post I will talk about what happened and what was said, but won’t mention any names or affiliations. You can see who attended at the <a href="http://satoshiroundtable.org/" rel="nofollow">event’s website</a>.</p>

<p>There were a couple of key moments that I remember. At one point, everybody was asked if they supported the “<a href="https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff#.osvy4i8sr" rel="nofollow">Hong Kong compromise</a>” from the week before (segregated witness in April, then code for a 2MB hard fork in July of 2016 with a minimum of a year before 2MB blocks are allowed).</p>

<p>“Everybody who support that, raise your hand” :  a dozen or so people, most of whom were part of that Hong Kong meeting, raise their hands.</p>

<p>“Everybody who does not support that, raise your hand” : everybody else (forty? fifty people?) raises their hands.</p>

<p>There was a lot of talk about moving the July of 2017 date closer. In particular, a plan was presented that had a three month grace period after 95% of hashpower voted yes and 75% of coin-age-weighted-transaction-volume-in-some-time-period also indicated support.</p>

<p>A subset of people spent several hours talking about the details, but reached no consensus. 95% miner voting is a problem for some miners, who don’t want to have veto power over such an important change. The chances of extortion either against them (“vote the way I want or I will DDoS you off the Internet”) or by them (“If you want me to vote a certain way, pay up”) are just too great.</p>

<p>And while the 75% coin-age voting is an interesting idea, actually agreeing on the details (Is there a fixed time period when the vote happens? A sliding window with a deadline? Should it be 75% of total transaction volume or just 75% of the volume that bothers to express a preference? Should it be 25% can veto instead of 75% needed to approve? Is this meant to be a vote or just a signal that people have upgraded?)  and then writing and reviewing the code would take months.</p>

<p>Over the last year of trying, and failing, to reach a reasonable compromise, it has become clear to me that some developers don’t want <em>any</em> on-chain scaling solution any time soon. They believe more theoretically elegant (but technically complicated) off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network are a better long-term scaling solution, and they believe that by resisting a simple limit increase we will get to that long-term solution faster.</p>

<p>They are wrong.</p>

<p>If the block size limit is not increased, we <em>will</em> see more off-chain solutions. But they won’t be the Lightning Network– instead, we will see highly centralized “clearing” agreements between exchanges and miners and merchants or merging of miners and transactions creators.</p>

<p>We can see this start to happen– BTCC is a large exchange and mining pool, and <a href="https://www.btcc.com/news/article/btcc-launches-blockpriority" rel="nofollow">announced “BlockPriority” last year</a> for its customers. I don’t blame BTCC at all for doing that, it makes perfect business sense.</p>

<p>It is, however, a symptom of an unhealthy network that is becoming increasingly unreliable and vulnerable to attacks.</p>
